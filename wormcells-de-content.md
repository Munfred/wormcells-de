# `wormcells-de`: Exploring C. elegans single cell RNA sequencing data  

The `wormcells-de` app allows you to perform differential expression on data from C. elegans single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). 21 experiments from 3 different studies were integrated and can be compared. That means you can select cells from two different experiments and perform differential expression on them!

Just select cell types and experiments to compare, some genes to highlight in your volcano plot, and leave your email. Results should arrive in less than 15 minutes. If they take more than an hour, something broke, so let me know by writing to eduardo@wormbase.org. Also feel free to write me if you have any feedback.


The single cell gene count matrixes were processed using a machine learning framework called [Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI)](https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI). The scVI framework enables integrating data from different sources (different experiments, batches and technologies), clustering and label transfer, and performing differential expression between clusters.

To learn how the plots were made, check out [this Jupyter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hF7KSujhhHcyxzWkzAHy9lazXLexainr) which performs differential expression as is here here. It runs on Google Colab so you can start playing right away.

The `wormcells-de` app is still in development and on this tool will inform how WormBase may incorporate and display single cell data in the future. 

# About the data

The 21 experiments come from 3 different studies and are described below. To perform a comparison, you must choose two groups. Each group can have any number of pairs (`cell_type`, `experiment`) to be compared.

The experiments are described below, and a full table of how many cells of each type were seen in each experiment [can be accessed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xm0D-gqN8uMkmTYBjl-VJftCbB6NOkoX1C2RLreGsfY/edit?usp=sharing). Note that sometimes experiments used slightly different labels for the same cell type, which is why there might be repetition. This table provides the original study annotations. In the future we might re-annotate the data with harmonized labels. 

## Cao 2017 L2 Larva Dataset (reprocessed)	
Cao and friends.[Comprehensive single-cell transcriptional profiling of a multicellular organism](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aam8940). Science 2017.

This was the first scRNAseq C. elegans data to be published. The single cell matrices used here were a newer version that was reprocessed and re-annotated and kindly provided by Robert Waterston and colleagues.

The technology used was sci-RNA seq. Two experiments with C. elegans at the L2 larval stage were performed with labels and cell counts as below. Their annotations define 117 cell types.

## Packer 2019 Embryogenesis Dataset				
Packer and friends.[A lineage-resolved molecular atlas of C. elegans embryogenesis at single-cell resolution](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6459/eaax1971.long). Science 2019.

In the paper supplements, the way the age of the embryos was defined is described as follows: _Around 250,000 L1 larvae were 29 plated onto four 100 mm petri plates seeded with NA22 bacteria and allowed to develop at 20 30 Â°C. As the worms reached the young adult stage, the population was closely monitored. When 31 about 20-30% of the adults had a single embryo in either arm of the gonad, worms were 32 subjected to hypochlorite treatment. The time hypochlorite was added to the worms was 33 considered t = 0._ 

They used 10x Genomics v2 chemistry to profile 89,701 cells, split as below. Their annotations define 183 cell types.

Taylor 2019 Neuron Dataset	
Taylor and friends. [Expression profiling of the mature C. elegans nervous system by single-cell RNA-Sequencing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737577v2). biorxiv 2019.

This is the first data release of the C. elegans Neuronal Gene Expression Map & Network (CeNGEN). The aim of the project is to establish a comprehensive gene expression atlas of an entire nervous system at single-neuron resolution, described in (the announcement publication)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.07.042]. Their website is [cengen.org](https://cengen.org).

As described in their website: _We are performing 10x single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-isolated neurons. Using 52,412 sequenced cells, 109/118 neuronal classes have been identified and computationally assigned to a cluster based on their gene expression fingerprint (93 confidently, 16 tentatively), and 9/118 classes have not been annotated yet._ 

They used 10x Genomics v2 chemistry to profile 65,450 cells from L4 stage larvae, split as below. Their annotations define 133 cell types.
