<p> To perform differential expression we use <a href="https://scvi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">scVI </a> v0.6.3.
    The method for performing differential expression is the `change` function, introduced in scVI v0.6.0 and described
    in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/794289">Boyeau et al, bioRxiv 2019 </a>.  It consists in estimating an effect
    size random variable (here, log2 fold-change) and performing Bayesian hypothesis testing on this variable.

    This allow us to estimate p-values and Bayes factors for the log-fold change, as well as
    the mean, median, and standard deviation.

    A tutorial on how to reproduce this analysis using the Packer 2019 dataset is available on the official scVI
    documentation at https://scvi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributed_tutorials/scVI_DE_worm.html



    For a given gene it performs hypothesis testing based on latent variable in the generative model that
    models the mean of the gene expression. We are comparing \(h_{1g}\), the mean expression of gene \(g\) in cell type \(1\) with \( h_{2g} \), the mean
    expression of \(g\) in cell type \(2\). The hypotheses are: </p>
<p>
    $$
    M^g_1: h_{1g} > h_{2g}
    $$

    $$
    M^g_2: h_{1g} \leq h_{2g}
    $$

    Differential expression between cell types 1 and 2 for each gene can then be based on the Bayes factors:

    $$
    \text{Natural Log Bayes Factor for gene g in cell types 1 and 2} = \ln ( {BF^g_{12}) = \ln(\frac{ p(M^g_1 | x_1,
    x_2)}{p(M^g_2 | x_1, x_2)}})
    $$

    Note that the results from scVI are provided using the natural logarithm of the Bayes Factor. This is \(
    \ln(BF_{10})\) in the table discussed below.

<h3>Interpreting Bayes factors</h3>
<p>To learn more about Bayes factors vs. p-values, see the review <a
        href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-statistics-031017-100307"> On p-Values and Bayes Factors </a> by Leonhard
    Held and Manuela Ott.</p>


<p>For a shorter overview, see <a href="https://www.nicebread.de/what-does-a-bayes-factor-feel-like"> this blog
    post</a>. A common interpretation table is copied below. <br>
    In our notation, \(BF_{10}\)  is \(BF^g_{12}\) , \(H_0\) is \(M^g_1\) and \(H_1\) is \(M^g_2\)
